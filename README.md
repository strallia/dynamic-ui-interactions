# Dynamic User Interface Interactions

# Purpose

Practice making dynamic drop-down menus, mobile menus, and image sliders with CSS transitions reusable JavaScript code.

# Reflection

- I liked the structure using function expressions gave over function declarations. The function can only be called after initializing the function expression. I had to think more about _where_ the blocks of code should belong.
- Code is more resusable if data is store in a JS object rather than messing with the HTML structure.
